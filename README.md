# Algorithms & DataStructures playbook

This repository contains implementations of most of the basic algorithms and data structures that
can be useful for preparing for a technical interview. The implementations are accompanied by
comments and illustrations that explain in detail every aspect of the algorithm’s operation and
are also covered with unit tests.
